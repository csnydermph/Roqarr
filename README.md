Hi, I’m Chris (@Roqarr). 
I am:
- a Master of Public Health
- a current PhD Student studying Sustainable Food Systems.

My project interests involve:
- choropleth mapping
- demographics and statistical research
- dynamic report generation of national-level public health data
- dynamic report generation from sensors on usb-gadgets and networked SBC's

My projects are made using:
- R, for data processing, GIS, and dynamic report generation
- Python, for collecting environmental data using SBC's and peripheral sensors
- Bash, for process automation and task scheduling



I am currently learning:
- Arduino, for possible smart agricultural implementation
- Raspberry Pi, for environmental data collection
 

I am looking to collaborate on:
- smart or precision agriculture 
- food security research 
- dynamic reporting projets using public data sets
